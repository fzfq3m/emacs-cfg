# Personal Emacs config
Initialization files and folder organization are heavily based on https://github.com/Borderliner/RME

## Installation

```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
git clone https://github.com/fzfq3m/emacs-cfg ~/.emacs.d
```

This config uses `Ubuntu Mono` as its default font. Get it [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono).
In case you want to use your own font, edit the config files in these places:
* `early-init.el` for Emacs 27.0 and newer
* `conf/init-ui.el` for Emacs 26.3 and older
